Data should be displayed on the screen in the form of a list, you should be able to load more data as you wish and interact with existing elements. Your solution should be sent to us as a link to Github and live demoUI Preview:

- List with initial 20 Pokémons, containing basic information like: ‘name’, `type` and ‘sprite’.
- Button to load more pokémons onto a screen.
